## Features

- **NIOS II Processor**: A configurable soft processor core that can be customized to meet specific application requirements.
- **FPGA Implementation**: The SoC is fully implemented on the DE1 Lite FPGA board, providing a hands-on experience with hardware-software co-design.
- **Digital Watch**: The software component includes a digital watch functionality that displays the current time.
- **Chronometer**: A built-in chronometer feature that allows users to measure elapsed time.

## Software

The software part of the project is designed to provide a functional digital watch that includes a chronometer. Key features of the software include:

- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time with hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Chronometer Functionality**: Allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer to measure elapsed time.
